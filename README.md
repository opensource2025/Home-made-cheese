# Description:    
A simple team project explaining how to make natural cheese and its main steps — heating, coagulation, pressing, and refrigeration — with a focus on its nutritional and health benefits.

# steps:  

## 1) objective:  
To prepare natural home made cheese using simple ingredients and biological processes that transform milk into a solid dairy product.
## 2) introduction:  
Cheese is one of the oldest and most popular dairy products in the world.  
It is obtained by coagulating milk using an enzyme or acid, then separating the solid curds from the liquid whey.
The process involves biological and chemical reactions that help milk turn into cheese.
## 3) Material and Equipment:  
* Utensils:

A pot (for heating milk)

A thermometer

A strainer or colander

A large spoon

A cheesecloth (or clean cotton cloth)

A bowl


* Equipment:

Stove or hot plate

Mold (optional, to shape the cheese)
## 4) ingredients:  

* 1 liter of fresh milk (preferably whole milk).
* 1 tablespoon of white vinegar or lemon juice (for acid coagulation).  
* A pinch of salt.  
* Optional: a few drops of rennet enzyme if available.  

## 5) procedure:  
* Heat the milk:
 
Pour the milk into the pot and heat it slowly to about 40–45°C (warm, not boiling).

* Add the coagulant:

Add the vinegar or lemon juice while stirring gently.

You will see the milk separating into curds (solid) and whey (liquid).  


* Let it rest:

 
Turn off the heat and let the mixture rest for 10–15 minutes until the curds form completely.



* Separate the curds:
    
Pour the mixture through the cheesecloth placed over a strainer to remove the whey.



* Press the cheese:
    
Gather the cloth and press gently to remove excess liquid.

You can place a weight on top for about 1 hour to get a firm texture.  



* Add salt and shape:

Open the cloth, add a little salt, and shape your cheese into a round or square block.



* Refrigerate:
    
Place it in the fridge for a few hours to cool and harden.

## 6) result:  
A fresh, white, soft cheese is obtained,  

It has a pleasant taste and can be used in salads, sandwiches, or cooking.
    
  ## 7) health benefits of natural cheese:  
  Natural cheese is not only delicious but also provides many health benefits:  

   * Rich in protein, which helps build and repair body tissues.  

   * Contains calcium and phosphorus, essential for strong bones and teeth.  

   * Provides vitamins A, B2, and B12, which support vision, metabolism, and the nervous system.  

   * Helps in maintaining gut health due to natural probiotics found in fermented cheeses.  

   * When consumed in moderation, it contributes to a balanced and healthy diet.
  ## 8) conclusion:  
Making natural cheese is an easy and educational process that shows how milk can be transformed into cheese through coagulation and separation.
It combines biology, chemistry, and food science in a simple experiment.
