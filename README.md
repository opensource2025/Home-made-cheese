## 5) procedure  
* Heat the milk:
 
Pour the milk into the pot and heat it slowly to about 40–45°C (warm, not boiling).



* Add the coagulant:

 
Add the vinegar or lemon juice while stirring gently.

You will see the milk separating into curds (solid) and whey (liquid).  



* Let it rest:

 
Turn off the heat and let the mixture rest for 10–15 minutes until the curds form completely.



* Separate the curds:
    
Pour the mixture through the cheesecloth placed over a strainer to remove the whey.



* Press the cheese:
    
Gather the cloth and press gently to remove excess liquid.

You can place a weight on top for about 1 hour to get a firm texture.  



* Add salt and shape:

Open the cloth, add a little salt, and shape your cheese into a round or square block.



* Refrigerate:
    
Place it in the fridge for a few hours to cool and harden.

## 6) result  
A fresh, white, soft cheese is obtained,  

It has a pleasant taste and can be used in salads, sandwiches, or cooking.
